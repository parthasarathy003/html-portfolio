        <h1><center>About Me – Partha Sarathy</center></h1>
        <p> I'm Partha Sarathy, a passionate learner, creator, and aspiring full-stack developer with a deep interest in cinema, technology, and investing. Currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, I enjoy building real-world applications, especially using the MERN stack. My curiosity has led me to explore everything from the Indian stock market to filmmaking and editing, and I’m constantly expanding my skill set.
            I believe in balancing creativity and logic — whether it’s coding a full-stack project, analyzing market trends, or editing videos with cinematic flair. I’ve completed internships in software development and launched a tech-based startup named Metalogic with my brother, where we aim to build solutions that make an impact.
            Apart from tech, I’m a consistent self-investor in both the stock market and self-improvement. I follow investment legends like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Warren Buffett, while keeping my strategies rooted in fundamentals and long-term value.
            I’m also a beginner content creator on Instagram and YouTube, sharing video edits and tech insights, and I’m building a life that balances ambition, learning, creativity, and contribution.
